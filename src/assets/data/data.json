If the conversation turns to food, Keith will almost always try and convince you and everyone around to get a slow cooker. Keith currently lives and works in Edinburgh, working for the Free Church of Scotland Office doing lots of secret work behind the scenes. He has previously lived in Cardiff, been a Ministry Apprentice, lived the Baywatch life as a lifeguard and set up his own business (car washing for all his neighbours).",

    "description" : "Just an Inverness girl living in Invergordon. Married to Calum Honda for 5 years, we have a big white fluffy dog, Bella & expecting our first baby in June. I LOVE a good chat, kayaking and watching Netflix (Brooklyn 99 & ‘The Crown’ are big favourites). I am also a fan of random fun facts, for example, did you know that hippos have red sweat?! Studied at Queen Margaret Uni in Edinburgh & now a community nurse in East Ross. I couldn’t ask for a better job as I get to roam to the Highlands instead of locked up in a hospital ward. My typical work route can take me past llama’s, dolphins; countless chickens and sheep… don’t see many of those on a ward!",

He is married, with six children (yes six children) and eight grandchildren.  He is a Paisley born lad, who in a previous life studied Electronics & Electrical Engineering at Robert Gordon’s University. He went on to work as a Microelectronics Engineer specialising in wet and dry etching techniques (whatever that is). Twelve years later, Iver began his Theological training and on completion, took up his first charge as the Assistant Minister of Stornoway Free Church. He later moved on to Bon Accord Free Church, however the pull of Stornoway was so strong that he returned six years later, only this time as the main pastor. He held that position for a further twelve years before embarking for the slightly drier and warmer climate of Edinburgh as Principal of ETS ",

  "message": "Dearest delegates,\n\n The time has finally come for us to Re-form after a year apart. Much has happened in our world since we last convened in Lendrick Muir a year ago… Just 2 weeks after the last conference, our nation's Convenor, Theresa Slay, triggered Article 50 and the subsequent bundles of joy and unanimous harmony on the streets since. Ed Sheeran MBE reigned supreme on Spotify and it’s been incredibly hard to avoid famous actors in Lycra saving the world from increasingly less coherent plotlines. Neymar, Stranger Things, Strong and Stable covfefe, La la land (or was it Moonlight?) and so much more. On a slightly more serious note, a lot has happened in our world that isn’t funny or cause for rejoicing. Looking at some 'Year in Review' articles before writing this made for a sobering reminder of the presence of evil and sin and the desperate need for Reformation. It’s once again time for the Youth Conference and I can’t wait to gather with you and be reminded of our need to always be working to ensure that our hearts and lives are being reformed by the Word and Spirit of God. \n\n Love John",

    "message": "Our House Parents this weekend are Murdo and Maggie Macleod. But Murdo is just his stage name: he is known by most as Mud. They’ve faced the treacherous A9 to travel down from Nairn where Mud has been the minister of Nairn Free Church since 2008. Mud is originally from Glasgow where he worked in publishing, with a bit of eldership on the side at Dowanvale Free Church. He made the move to Edinburgh when he married Maggie: who had left the cosmopolitan life of North Tolsta, Isle of Lewis to pursue a career in midwifery in Edinburgh. Later on, during his mid-life crisis, Mud studied at ETS and became a minister. They have two children: Angus and Kirsty. Angus managed to dodge the embarrassment of attending the Youth Conference with his parents but Kirsty was not so lucky. Their third child is called Bonnie, and whilst border collie in form, is really just another family member. Mud and Maggie are an incredibly warm, friendly and Godly couple, do make sure you speak to them at some point during the weekend. But fair warning: Mud’s jokes are notoriously bad and may incite unbearable levels of cringe."
