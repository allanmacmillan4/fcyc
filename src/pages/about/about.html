      <h2 text-center> Iver Martin</h2><br>
      <p text-justify style="white-space:normal">This year we are delighted to welcome our main speaker – Principal Iver Martin. Iver is currently the Principal of Edinburgh Theological Seminary and has been since 2015. He is married, with six children (yes six children) and eight grandchildren. 
        <br><br>He is a Paisley born lad, who in a previous life studied Electronics & Electrical Engineering at Robert Gordon’s University. He went on to work as a Microelectronics Engineer specialising in wet and dry etching techniques (whatever that is). Twelve years later, Iver began his Theological training and on completion, took up his first charge as the Assistant Minister of Stornoway Free Church. He later moved on to Bon Accord Free Church, however the pull of Stornoway was so strong that he returned six years later, only this time as the main pastor. He held that position for a further twelve years before embarking for the slightly drier and warmer climate of Edinburgh as Principal of ETS. 
        <br><br>As an FCYC veteran, we are excited to have him back with us and look forward to the insight that he will share with us from God’s Word</p>

      <p text-justify style="white-space:normal">We call ourselves Reformed, we are part of a Reformed church, but do we know what that even means?! 
<br><br>Don't fret, this is not a boring history lecture about the Reformation, but an insight into the practical applications of what the Reformation brought about. We want to uncover some of the truths that the Reformation brought to light: A rediscovery of worship, the church and salvation. 
<br><br>We want to take Reformation, and put it into practice!</p>
